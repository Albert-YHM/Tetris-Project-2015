# Tetris-Project-2015
- An old high school project I did in C#
- Mostly did it because my old high school teacher didn't think I could complete it.
- Hopefully it showcases at least some coding know how / potential
- PS. The volume up and down buttons were a joke, so the volume increases regardless of what is pressed

- To try it out download the .exe file which can be found in:
  tetris test => tetris test => bin => release => "tetris test.exe"
